Python Dictionaries - Lists vs. Dictionaries 
Dictionaries are Key:Value pairs of objects in 
a list like structure.

Challenge #1
Run the code, Explain the difference between lists and dictionaries
      Lists are a linear collection of values in order while a Dictionary is a bag of values with different labels.
- See that the list is index'able
- See that the Dictionary is a keyword:value pair

- How do you "index" a dictionary?

- Add an additional key:value pair to the ddd dictionary
  Imagine that this is a dictionary for a college engineering class.  
  Does it have a lab? 'lab':'true' , add a short description for 
  the class. 'description':'short string describing the class'

      ''')

lst = list()
lst.append(183)
lst.append("2:00 PM")
print(lst)
lst[1] = "3:00 PM"
print(lst)
print(lst[1])
print()

college_engineering_class = dict()
college_engineering_class['course'] = 182
college_engineering_class['time'] = "2:00 PM"
print(college_engineering_class)
college_engineering_class['time'] = "3:00 PM"
print(college_engineering_class)
print(college_engineering_class['time'])

college_engineering_class['lab'] = "true"
college_engineering_class['description'] = "This introductory course explores the different engineering disciplines to assist students in a choice of a major in engineering."
print(college_engineering_class)

print()
print("College Engineering Class Information")
print("Course:", college_engineering_class["course"])
print("Time:", college_engineering_class["time"])
print("Lab:", college_engineering_class["lab"])
print("Description:", college_engineering_class["description"])

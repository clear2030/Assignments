Boolean means it can only be "TRUE" or "FALSE", 1 or 0.  
If you are performing a comparison or evaluation, the

that answer, you can make program flow decisions.

Challenge # 1
----------------------------------------------------
Can you explain?

What do the following mean?
1) Assignment 
   Assignment is when you assign/initialize values to a variable.
2) Comparison
   Comparison is when you compare the values of two values/variables.
3) Evaluation
   Evaluation is when the value of an expression is evaluated/found, like for the expressio 5>4, this would be evaluated to true.
4) What is the difference between "=" and "=="
   "=" is an assignment and is used to just initialize a variable for example, while "==" is used to compare two values.
5) Boolean
   a Booleam is a type that can either be true or false (1 or 0).

Challenge #1
Write some code that uses the following built-in functions
Run, then Edit the code in the template example:
      
Using some built-in Functions
- abs()    - try some equation like x=(4+5)*-7
- bin()    - change a decimal number to it's binary
- ord()    - convert a number or character to it's unicode value
- chr()    - convert a unicode value to it printable character
- round()  - Do some math, get a long floating point number and
             round it.  Then round it to 2 significant digits
- Pick 3 more functions ant try them...
- Still have time, pick 3 more
